        <h1>On Money, the Economy, and the Need for a Basic Income</h1>
        <br><br><br>
        <div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-3"></div>
    <article class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-3">
        With the rise of cryptocurrency from 2009-present, a need arises to question and clarify
    the nature of money. What, exactly, is money? What is its nature? And how should we analyze
    and understand a monetary economic system?<br><br>

    Money has arisen spontaneously numerous times in human history. In colonial settlements
    and in prison camps, tobacco and cigarettes have taken on the function of money in the absence
    of other alternatives (reference). Shells, metals, and even large stones have served as money in
    different times and places (stone money link).<br><br>

    Money serves a basic function in enabling trade by eliminating the necessity of the
    double-coincidence of wants (reference). It may be observed that it’s difficult enough to find a
    buyer for a given product or service. If, as in barter, it is also necessary for the buyer to possess
    something that one also wants to buy, the difficulty increases a great deal.<br><br>

    This problem is solved by trading products for a widely valued and accepted item (a sale)
    which can then be held until such time as one would like to purchase something from someone
    else, at which time the item can then be traded again to the seller of the desired good (a
    purchase).<br><br>

    The widely valued and accepted item needs only these two properties to function
    effectively as money.
    How, then, to analyze and understand the characteristics and functioning of money in a
    monetary economy? The role of prices in balancing supply and demand in a free market is wellanalyzed and widely understood. But what about the price of money itself?<br><br>

    -Stocks and flows<br><br><br>

    While the supply, demand, and market price of many products and services is most
    naturally understood in terms of flows over time (a producer produces X widgets/month in order
    to match the demand of consumers to consume X widgets/month at the market price), an
    understanding of the nature of money is most naturally arrived at by examining both the stock of
    money (the money supply), as well as the flows of money (monetary transactions). More often,
    money is transacted, by passing from one hand to another; less often is it created or destroyed.
    Money demand, then, is the demand for a stock of money, which is to be held between
    the time of selling something and acquiring the money, and purchasing something else and
    divesting the money.<br><br>

    On the short end, this may be as short as a day or a few days between selling something
    for money and purchasing something with the money acquired. On the long end, an individual
    may wish to save up a year’s worth of expenses or more in money savings.
    Imagine a small economy made up of 10 participants who trade goods and services with
    each other. Suppose the total value of goods and services traded is $1 million. How much is
    money demand in the economy?<br><br>

    Money demand will depend on how much the participants desire to save in money. If the
    participants’ desire to have a cash buffer of 1 months’ worth of expenses, then total money
    demand in the economy will be 1 months’ worth of trade, in our example about $83,333 worth of
    money. If, on the other extreme, participants desire to save on average a cash buffer of 5 years’
    worth of expenses, then total money demand in the economy will be 5 years’ worth of trader, or
    about $5 million in total across the entire economy.<br><br>

    -Chart here<br><br><br>

    But what about investment? Above a certain amount of cash buffer, participants may want
    to invest their savings into something more productive. Capital investment may be the most
    important factor in the modern economy.<br><br>

    The modern economy can be thought of as a “Partially Automated Factory.” Whereas a
    completely “Automated Factory” would produce goods and perhaps services without the need for
    any labor input, our “Partially Automated Factory” economy still requires some labor input.
    However, it is far more productive than the labor input would be in the absence of the “factory.”
    This “factory” comes into existence through capital investment, which is investment into
    machinery and technology which increases labor productivity and decreases the need for labor in
    the production of a given amount of goods and services. Examples include textile machinery,
    motorized farm equipment, robotic automobile production lines, etc.<br><br>

    -Chart here<br><br><br>

    Note that the accumulation of capital and the resulting productivity growth should
    theoretically produce a more productive and therefore prosperous society. The problem comes in
    through the tendency of capital investment and capital ownership to be concentrated in the hands
    of wealthy capitalists. The vast majority of everyone else own relatively little capital and function in
    society as worker-consumers, selling their labor for labor income and using that to purchase the
    goods and services they want and need.<br><br>

    Alan Watts spoke of what I will call the “Automated Factory Paradox,” whereby a
    businessman invests in building a wonderful automated factory, lays off all his workers, and then
    turns around to find that there are no customers for the products that his factory produces,
    because they’ve all been laid off.<br><br>

    How would we know if this is occurring in society? If a reduction in labor demand due to
    productivity growth were holding back the prosperity of society, we would expect that, like
    Watts’s laid-off workers, the consumer-worker would have insufficient income and therefore be
    unable to purchase the full production of the “factories” (literal and metaphorical) in the economy.
    This would result in spare and idle capacity, as we might imagine Watts’s businessman would
    face.<br><br>

    The St. Louis Federal Reserve publishes a measure of capacity utilization, which is as
    broad as possible, including primary and manufacturing industries, and attempts to estimate how
    much of capacity is in use in comparison to the maximum output of current existing capacity. This
    measure peaks in the 1970’s and shows a robust long-term down trend from the end of the
    1970’s to the present day, with current levels around 70+% close to the levels immediately
    preceding the Great Depression.<br><br>

    The “Automated Factory Paradox” can also be called the “Paradox of the WorkerConsumer.” Labor income and consumer spending form a feedback loop because the consumerworker’s spending is dependent on the labor income they receive. At the same time, labor income
    is dependent upon labor demand, which is dependent on the level of consumer spending.
    When labor income growth is strong, it will feed strong spending growth, which will cause
    labor income growth to be strong again in the next time period. This virtuous cycle is
    hypothesized to have occurred from 1940 to the 1970’s, resulting in the “Golden Age” of strong
    income growth, and strong productivity growth, and declining wealth inequality.<br><br>

    The opposite state is when labor income growth stagnates relative to the growth of the
    economy, it will cause spending to also stagnate, which will cause labor demand and labor
    income to continue to stagnate in the next time period. This is hypothesized to have occurred
    from 1980 to the present era, and would have resulted in increasing wealth inequality.
    These long-term secular trends are visible in the long-term upward trend in capacity
    utilization from 1940 to the 1970’s, and in the long-term downward trend in capacity utilization
    from 1980 to the present era. These trends are mirrored in long-term market interest rates,
    because weak demand reduces the need for real capital investment, which affects the demand for
    investment capital.<br><br>

    It should seem obvious that if capacity in the economy is not well-utilized, then the
    economy is not producing as much as value as could theoretically be possible. The only argument
    might be that labor, and not just capacity, is a limiting factor on how much the economy can
    produce. Indeed, the unemployment rate has sometimes been used by economists to estimate
    what “potential GDP” might be if the economy reached “full potential.”
    This type of estimation carries strong and unsupported assumptions, which should be
    questioned for the following reasons. In the short term, much of employed labor hours are
    unproductive and do not directly affect the amount of production.<br><br>

    In a pizza shop, if demand on a particular day is high, the employees may be fully
    occupied on that day. On other days, if demand is low, the employees may have no productive
    uses for their time during hours of employment. As a result, the number of employee labor hours
    truly necessary for the production and delivery of a certain quantity of pizza in a month is fairly
    subjective, and a modest decrease in labor available would be unlikely to affect the amount of
    pizza produced.<br><br>

    In a large manufacturing company with multiple layers of management, it’s common for
    significant time to be spent in internal meetings. The relationship between this time spent and the
    revenues or production of the company is also hazy, and it’s unlikely that a modest decrease in
    labor hours available for these meetings would affect the amount of revenues or production at the
    company.<br><br>

    In the medium-to-long term, productivity growth becomes a much larger factor. We have
    no more and likely less labor hours per capita available in our economy than we did 200 years, yet
    per capita production is on the order of 100x higher now than then.
    This is due almost entirely to capital investment (in the broadest sense), including here
    scientific and technological investment. However, in the presence of insufficient labor demand
    and insufficient spending (aggregate demand) due to the Paradox of the Worker-Consumer,
    capital investment to increase production will be less profitable than otherwise due to the difficulty
    in selling any increased production to the worker-consumer. Also, capital investment to enhance
    worker productivity will also be less profitable than otherwise, because labor demand and market
    wages will be lower than they otherwise would be.<br><br>

    It can be considered that a rapid increase in utilization in the economy would initially cause
    strain in terms of tight labor markets and rising wages. The natural response of markets would be
    to allocate the scarce resource of labor more sparingly through investment into productivityenhancing capital and the elimination of unnecessary, unproductive, and automat-able jobs,
    leaving behind only the most valued, productive, and necessary jobs to be done by workers who
    would now be in tight supply due to higher demand.<br><br>

    So how can this increase in utilization to realize the full capacity of the economy be
    brought about?
    The natural solution would be to increase the income of the consumer-worker. This could
    be done by directing the Federal Reserve to send “helicopter money” directly to the people as
    Universal Basic Income.
    Taxes are not necessary to “fund” the UBI, as the existence of capacity, particularly
    unused capacity, is what actually “funds” the UBI. However, the author considers that taxes are
    necessary to maintain the financial sustainability and stability of the government, and should be
    increased for that purpose, particularly for the wealthy, but these taxes are not necessary for a
    UBI.<br><br>

    What is MADAO?
    While a UBI issued by the relevant central banks would be most effective most quickly, in
    the absence of immediate government action in this direction, an organization has been formed to
    issue a UBI to any community member who signs up. This UBI will issued as a cryptocurrency
    token on the Cardano (ADA) blockchain, and will function as a digital UBI-enabled community
    currency. The currency and the organization are named MADAO, for Mutual Aid DAO.<br><br>

    The MADAO token can be spent or earned on the MADAO Marketplace Discord server,
    which can be found at (URL). In its earliest stages, the MADAO token allows and promotes mutual
    aid between the members of the community. Our vision is to grow the micro-economy that
    MADAO enables to the point where a UBI amount of $1300 or more can be issued, and MADAO
    can be widely used for any good or service needed in the digital or physical world.<br><br>
